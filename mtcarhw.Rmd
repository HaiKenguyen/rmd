```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r mtcars}
summary(mtcars)
cyl_4 <- mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 4,]
cyl_6 <- mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 6,]
print(cyl_4)
print(cyl_6)


```{r mtcars, echo=FALSE}
plot(cyl_4$mpg, cyl_4$disp, ylab = "Engine Displacement", xlab = "mpg", main = "Engines with 4 Cylinders")
plot(cyl_6$mpg, cyl_6$disp, ylab = "Engine Displacement", xlab = "mpg", main = "Engines with 6 Cylinders")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
